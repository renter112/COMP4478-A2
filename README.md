COMP-4478 
Assignment 2
Space Game Improvements

Moved controls ->
A/D for Left/Right
O for shooting
P for escape-danger mode (smaller hitbox, no shooting and faster movement)


Increased Land Speed, added trees & made it infinite
Increased general game speed
Added Bonus, every 50 kills 3shot for 2sec
Health -> 5 lives
Score -> each kill gets points
When bonus active, guns appear on wings

Tried adding enemy bullets, got prefab working & spawning working
collision would not work, not sure why...
